		\opening{Dear Sir/Madam} 
	
I am writing to you because I have lost my camera during my holiday. 
To the best of my knowledge my insurance (insurance no. 1234) covers against lost of valuable items. 
I hope you can refund the estimated cost of the lost items. 


My camera was a Nikon D3300 and it was produced in 2015. 
It was quite new because I only used it on holidays. 
The camera was in a olive green and black satchel. 
The bag also contained a spare battery and a charger. 

The satchel was lost in Imaginary Cafe, Budapest. 
On the terrace of the cafe, I put down the satchel and my backpack next to my table. 
I spent about 30 minutes there and when I was leaving, I found my satchel missing. 

I hope you can refund the cost of the lost items. I value the lost items about 500 USD. This amount of money would be enough to purchase a new camera, a spare battery and a bag. I hope your appraiser will calculate similar value. My bank account number is 12344321-12344321-12344321.
